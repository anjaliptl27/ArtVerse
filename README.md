# ArtVerse: Where Art Meets Community üé®

Hey there! I'm Anjali, the creator behind ArtVerse. This is my hobby project.
ArtVerse is a comprehensive digital platform that connects art enthusiasts with talented artists worldwide. It serves as both a marketplace for buying/selling artwork and a learning platform for art education.

## Motivation and purpose

As both an artist and developer, I noticed three critical gaps in the digital art space:

- Fragmented platforms - Small artists juggle multiple sites for selling work, selling courses, and no platform for commission posting
- Limited discovery - Buyers struggle to find authentic art, browse suitable artists to request commissioned artwork and learning resources in one place
- Financial barriers - Emerging artists face high commission fees on existing platforms

ArtVerse solves these problems by creating an integrated ecosystem where artists can monetize their skills through multiple channels while buyers enjoy seamless access to both artwork and education.

## Behind the Scenes üõ†Ô∏è

Building this has been equal parts exhilarating and frustrating. Some real talk:

**Wins I'm Proud Of:**
- Built a commission system that protects both artists and buyers

**Hard Lessons Learned:**
- Image uploads will test your patience (Cloudinary saved me)
- Authentication is way more complex than tutorials suggest

## Features That Actually Help People

### For Artists:
- **Your All-in-One Hub** - Sell originals, take commissions, and teach - all from one profile
- **Keep More Earnings** - Only 10% platform fee (compare that to 30-50% elsewhere) that too when you sale!

### For Art Lovers:
- **Discover + Learn** - Find amazing art, then learn how it's made from the same artist
- **Commission with Confidence** - Clear pricing, timelines, and progress tracking
